Baneforge
=========

A multiplayer RPG game built with LWJGL

Codebase is very rough, did not know fundamental Java programming skills during the first half of development.  This was a learning project!

Because of this, you will note that 50% of the code is in a single class called "Core" which serves as the main class.  Also, files are not arranged into folders.  This should probably be refactored before work continues :)
